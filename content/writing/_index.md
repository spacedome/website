### Matrix Multiplication (2018) \[[pdf](/pdf/matrixmult.pdf)\]
A brief (seven page) introduction to Numerical Linear Algebra (NLA), by way of the humble Matrix Multiplication.
Although it is perhaps the most fundamental matrix operation, it is somewhat unique, in particular the Strassen Algorithm (and even more so the Coppersmith-Winograd Algorithm) is quite unlike anything else I have seen in Numerical Linear Algebra.
This essay goes as far as Strassen, but refrains from going into blocking, memory layouts, and caching, i.e. the "real" matrix multiplication of BLAS and MKL, as discussing the details of these in a first introduction would be painful at best.
