<h2>Poem 5</h2>

Steam roars through cryptic boiler

These cold and bloodless men pour out from the edifice 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€” a violent liquidation

In midnight sun their fridgid bodies crackle

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free these ruined shells in putrefying light

Grotesque particles liberated at the last

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing to the end of time in this field of frozen death
