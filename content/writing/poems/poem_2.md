<h2>Poem 2</h2>

Whisper me your wayward secrets,

&nbsp;&nbsp; they are ours together in this cruel and burning night

Debase me in your turbid violence,

&nbsp;&nbsp; we now and always yearn this starving horror

See me of your inner visions - in dark and clouded eye,

&nbsp;&nbsp; another future loudly beckons
